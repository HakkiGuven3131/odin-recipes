    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Patlican kebabi, or eggplant kebab, is a traditional Turkish dish that features grilled or roasted eggplant (aubergine) as the main ingredient. The eggplant is typically charred over an open flame or roasted until soft and tender, giving it a smoky flavor and a creamy texture.</p>
    <p>To make patlican kebabi, the grilled or roasted eggplant is peeled and mashed, then mixed with various ingredients such as garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and spices like cumin and paprika. The mixture is then shaped into patties or balls and grilled or fried until golden brown and crispy on the outside.

        Patlican kebabi is often served with yogurt sauce, chopped tomatoes, and parsley. It can be enjoyed as a main dish or as part of a meze spread. The combination of smoky eggplant, aromatic spices, and creamy yogurt sauce makes it a flavorful and satisfying dish.</p>
