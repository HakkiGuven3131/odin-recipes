        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef or lamb with finely chopped onion, minced garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine all the ingredients evenly.</li>
            <li>Take a portion of the meat mixture and shape it into a long, cylindrical or roll-like shape, similar to a sausage. Repeat with the remaining mixture.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of lavash or yufka flatbread on a clean surface.
                Place one of the meat cylinders along one edge of the flatbread and roll it up tightly, enclosing the meat completely. Repeat with the remaining meat and flatbread.</li>
                <li>Place the wrapped meat rolls in the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and the flatbread is crispy and golden brown on all sides.</li>
                <li>Remove the cooked Beyti Kebabs from the skillet and let them cool slightly.
                    Slice the Beyti Kebabs into smaller pieces and arrange them on a serving platter.
                    Serve the Beyti Kebabs with a side of yogurt, tomato sauce, and rice pilaf.
